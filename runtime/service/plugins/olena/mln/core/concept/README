Milena Concepts

FIXME: It'd be better to turn this file into a Doxygen documentation.
In fact, the best place where to put this documentation is in the
concept files themselves, but we'd like a kind of centralized summary
too.  An index would be nice.

See what Doxygen's \page provides.

* Image
Images are functions mapping point sites from a given domain (point
site set) to a value.

* Point Site
[...]
The most general point site is linked to a domain, and cannot be used
with another domain.

* Point
A point is a point site, belonging to a domain (point set) compatible
with several images.  Thus, points can be used with different images.

* Point Site Set
FIXME: Is there a difference between a point site set and a point set?

* Point Set
Also called psite.

* Point Site Iterator
Also called psite iterator.

* Point Iterator
Also called piter.

* Grid

* Graph

* Window
A function mapping a point site to a set of point sites.  The term
``window'' is both used to name the function and the (mapped) set of
point site (image in the mathematical sense). There are no additionnal
requirement on the structure of set of the mapped point sites.

* Neighborhood
A function mapping a point site to a set of point sites.  The term
``neighborhood'' is both used to name the function and the (mapped)
set of point site (image in the mathematical sense). The neighborhood
relationship must be symmetric: if B is in the neighborhood of A, then
A must be in the neighborhood of B.  Neighborhoods are attached to
images: an algorithm working on the neighborhood of an image shall get
the neighborhood from the input image(s), not from an extra argument
passed to the algorithm.

* Window Iterator
Also called qiter.

* Neighborhood Iterator
Also called niter.
(FIXME: Do they actually exist in Milena?  The current trend in Milena
is to convert neighborhoods to windows in implementations, hence only
window iterators are used.)
