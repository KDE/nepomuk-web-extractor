** The functor should provide the following methods:
**
**    - template <typename G> void init(const Graph<G>& g)
**	  Will be called at the beginning.
**
**    - bool to_be_treated(unsigned id)
**	  Return whether this vertex has already been marked or if it may be a
**	  a component representative.
**
**    - void new_component_from_vertex(unsigned id)
**	  will be called for the first vertex encountered for each component.
**
**    - void process_vertex(unsigned id)
**	  Will be called for each vertex queued.
**
**    - bool to_be_queued(unsigned id)
**	  Return whether this vertex has already been marked or if it can be added
**	  to the current component.
**
**    - void added_to_queue(unsigned id)
**	  Will be called for every vertex encountered in each component, except
**	  the first one.
**
**    - void next_component()
**	  Will be called after all vertices from a component have been treated.
**
**    - void final()
**	  Will be called at the end;
