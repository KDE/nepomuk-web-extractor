== INSTALLATION ==

Create build directory anywhere
> mkdir build_dir

Cd into this dircetory and run cmake
> cd build_dir
> ccmake <path/to/source/dir>

Configure and generated makefiles

Now, you HAVE TO first install lib subfolder, and only then - 
runtime

cd lib; make install; cd ../
cd runtime; make install; cd ../

Otherwise, webexconsole wouldn't build
